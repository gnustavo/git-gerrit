README - The git-gerrit script is a Git extension to implement a
Gerrit workflow.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

WARNING: THIS IS STILL BETA CODE.

Git-gerrit is a Git extension to manage changes using L<Gerrit Code
Review|http://code.google.com/p/gerrit/>.

Git-gerrit offers a rich set of sub-commands to make it easy to
create, query, amend, review, and submit changes to Gerrit, making it
possible to interact with it through the command-line, avoiding its
web interface most of the time and improving your efficiency. The goal
is to make Gerrit's review process feel like a natural extension of
Git.

Git-gerrit was originally inspired by the
L<git-review|https://github.com/openstack-infra/git-review> script,
which is used by some very well-known projects, such as OpenStack,
MediaWiki, and LibreOffice. It also draws from other scripts such as
L<git-change|https://github.com/Nextdoor/git-change> and
L<querrit|https://gitorious.org/querrit/querrit>. However, while those
scripts are based on Gerrit's old SSH API, git-gerrit is based on
Gerrit's new REST API, taking advantage of its richer functionality.

For the complete documentation, installation, and configuration
instructions, please, read the manpage of the L<git-gerrit(1)> script.

=head1 TODO

An incomplete list of things to do in random order:

=over

=item * Test, test, test, ...

=item * checkout CHANGE.patchsetNumber

Allow for the checkout of a specific patchset of a change.

=item * implement 'git gerrit cherrypick'

From git-review.

=item * implement 'git gerrit diff'

To show diffs between patchsets.

=item * implement the '--dry-run' option

To avoid running non-query commands.

=item * implement 'git gerrit log'

=item * implement extensibility by plugins

An example of a useful plugin would be to integrate change management
with JIRA or other ticketing systems. Something like
L<this|https://npmjs.org/package/git-jira>.

Another one would be to invite reviewers based on the history of the
files/lines touched by the change.

=item * implement a bash completion script

=item * support named-queries via git-gerrit.query configuration.

This idea comes from L<querrit|https://gitorious.org/querrit/querrit>
shortcuts.

=item * implement 'git gerrit checkout topic'

To checkout one or more changes associated with a Gerrit topic.

=item * show votes with --verbose

This should work on 'git gerrit show' and 'git gerrit query'.

=item * better format the output of 'git gerrit query'

I'm thinking about using Text::Table to do it.

=item * 'git gerrit review --verbose'

This should work like 'git commit --verbose' so that the diff should
be inserted in the temporary file created to invoke Git's editor. This
way the user would be able to better study the change while he's
composing a review message.

=item * implement inline comments

With 'git gerrit review --verbose' it should be possible to allow the
user to insert comments below the diff lines. These comments would be
recorded as draft comments associated with files or lines.

This would be really cool.
